                                            They are called "solar" panels because most of the time, the most powerful source of light available is the Sun, called Sol by astronomers.

                                            A photovoltaic cell, also called a "solar cell" are the basic building blocks of solar panels.
                                            <br />
                                            A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell, is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon.
                                            <br />
                                            It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as current, voltage, or resistance, vary when exposed to light.
                                            <br />
                                            The common type is a wafer made of pure silicon, one of the most abundant materials on earth.
                                            <br />
                                            This wafer is "doped" with minute quantities of boron, phosphorous, gallium or other exotic sounding materials.
                                            <br />
                                            Each cell develops about 0.5 volts of DC electrical potential when exposed to light.
                                            <br />
                                            The maximum current it can produce depends on the cell's surface area and the intensity of the light.
                                            <br />
                                            PV cells can produce electricity for up to 50 years! The energy that was required to manufacture them will be generated by the PV cell in only a few years.
                                            <br />
                                            The operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires 3 basic attributes:

                                            Mulltiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module.
                                            <br />
                                            Solar cells are usually connected in series in modules, creating an additive voltage.

                                            <br />
                                            Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage.
                                            <br />
                                            Traditionally modules with 36 cells were made, producing around 18 volts for a 12 volt nominal output (36 x 0.5 V = 18 V).
                                            <br />
                                            Since the advent of MPPT (maximum power point trackers) technology, modules with more cells are being made, producing higher voltages.
                                            <br />
                                            Note: Only modules with 36 cells (with Vmp around 18 volts) are suitable for use with PWM type controllers.

                                            Such an array could be mounted on multiple racks and sometimes the term "sub array" is used to mean one rack of modules in a multiple-rack array.

                                            When we connect electrical sources in series, the current remains the same but the voltage is increased, which is exactly the goal of a string!

                                            It is the same as when you put three 1.5 Volt cells in your torch - they are in series to build the voltage to 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 V.                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Larger off grid PV systems can operate at voltages of up to 150 VDC and grid-tied systems can use up to 600 volts.
                                            <br />
                                            A series string can also be paralleled with other series strings which will increase the charging current.

                                Usually the Standard test conditions (STC) given for a panel is 25°. Realistically we know that is very seldom the case.

                                The power temperature correction factor shoudl be given on a spec sheet. In this example power will reduce by 0.4% for every degree above 25°(STC)!

                                Realistic cell temperatures can easily be 55 degrees plus which in this example would reduce a 250Wp to 220Watts.

                                55°C -25°C = 30° x (0.4% of 250) = 30 x 1 Thus 250 – 30 = 220 Watts.

                                On a lovely hot sunny day a 250 Wp module will effectively produce 220 Watts of power!

                                According to the small print the 250 Minimum Watts could be onlty 237.5 Watts at STC conditions!

                                250 – 5% = 237.5 Wp!

                                Thus if we take the 237.5 watts and include the temperature factor we end up with effective watts of 209 watts!

                                In this example the company only give a tiered warranty of 5 years for the product and an 80% yield over 20 years. One could theoretically loose 20% in the first year!
