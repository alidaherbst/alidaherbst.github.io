                                            A charge controller or regulator is an essential part of any power system that charges batteries. Its job is to keep the batteries properly fed and happy whilst ensuring a long battery life. A charge controller  limits the rate at which electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan, and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life. The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a stand-alone device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery charger.                                            <ul></ul>

                                        <p class="paragraph">

                                            In solar applications, charge controllers may also be called solar regulators. Some charge controllers / solar regulators have additional features, such as a low voltage disconnect (LVD), a separate circuit which powers down the load when the batteries become overly discharged.

                                            Simple or regular charge controllers stop charging a battery when they exceed a set high voltage level, and re-enable charging when the battery voltage drop below that level. Smarter charge controllers like PWM (Pulse width modulation) and MPPT(maximum power point tracker)  will adjust the charging rates depending on the battery’s level to allow charging closer to its maximum capacity

                                            Even though solar cells are neat they as well as batteries are not very smart. Most PV panels are built to output a nominal 12 volts. Unfortunately the nominal and actual are different and most solar panels have an actual output from 16-18 volts! In batteries the nominal 12 volts are closer to the actual than solar panels and they range from 10.5 to 12.7 volts depending on the state of charge (Soc). Batteries need around 13.2 to 14.4 volts to fully charge quite different from the 16-18 volts from the solar panel.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                            Let’s look for example at the Kyocera KC-130 solar panel (rated at a particular voltage and current) which is rated at 7.39 amps at 17.6 volts. (7.39 amps times 17.6 volts = 130 watts). <br />
                                            If you hook this panel up to a 12 volt battery using a regular charge controller you would have only 88.8 watts (7.4 amps times 12 volts = 88 watts). <br />
                                            You paid for 130 watts but lost 41 watts because there is a poor match between the panel and the battery.<br />
                                            You would loose even more with a battery of 10.5 watts! (11 volts times 7.4 amps = 51.4 watts – lost 48 watts close to 35% )
                                            <br />
                                            Unfortunately one cannot adjust panels to match the battery as a panel need leeway to perform under the worst of conditions. If the temperature of the solar panel is high you would not get your 17.4 volts but might get under 16 volts.
                                            <br />
                                            Optimising is when a charge controller looks at the output of the panels, and compares it to the battery voltage. It then figures out what is the best power that the panel can put out to charge the battery. It takes this and converts it to best voltage to get maximum AMPS into the battery. It is important to know that it is the Amps into the battery that counts!
                                            <br />
                                            Most modern MPPT's are around 93-97% efficient in the conversion. You typically get a 20 to 45% power gain in winter and 10-15% in summer. Actual gain can vary widely depending weather, temperature, battery state of charge, and other factors.

                                            <img src="../images/pwm.png" alt="PWM Charge Controller" width="490" height="122" align="center" /> <br />

                                            <br />
                                            PWM((Pulse width modulation) charge controller  is basically a switch that connects a solar array to the battery . The voltage of the array is pulled down to near that of the battery.  A PWM type controller holds the voltage more constant. If it has two-stage regulation, it will first hold the voltage to a safe maximum for the battery to reach full charge. Then it will drop the voltage lower to sustain a "finish" or trickle charge. Two-stage regulation is especially important for a system that may have many days of excess energy (or little use of energy). It maintains a full charge but minimizes water loss and battery stress.
                                            <br />
                                            When a solar array is connected to the battery through a PWM charge controller, its voltage will be pulled down to near that of the battery. This leads to a suboptimal power output wattage (Watt = Amp x Volt) at low and at very high solar cell temperatures. In times of rainy or heavily clouded days or during heavy intermittent loads a situation may occur where the battery voltage becomes lower than is normal. This would further pull down the panel voltage; thus degrading the output even further. At very high cell temperatures the voltage drop off point may decrease below the voltage needed to fully charge the battery. As array area increases linearly with power, cabling cross sectional area and cable length therefore both increase with power, resulting in substantial cable costs, in the case of arrays exceeding a few 100 Watts. The PWM charge controller is therefore a good low cost solution for small systems only, when cell temperature is moderate too high (between 45°C and 75°C).
                                            <br />
                                            Systems in which array power output is significantly larger than the power draw of the system loads would indicate that the batteries will spend most of their time at full or near full charge. Such a system may not benefit from the increased harvesting capability of an MPPT regulator. When the system batteries are full, excess solar energy goes unused. The harvesting advantage of MPPT may be unnecessary in this situation.
                                            <br />
                                            PWM controllers are ideal for small single module applications and camping solutions. With any system that yields 1 kWh or more, the additional cost of MMPT controllers are very quickly offset by the power gains obtained.

                                            MPPT(maximum power point tracker)  besides performing the function of a basic controller, an MPPT controller also includes a DC to DC voltage converter, converting the voltage of the array to that required by the batteries, with very little loss of power.  An MPPT controller attempts to harvest power from the array near its Maximum Power Point, whilst supplying the varying voltage requirements of the battery plus load. When compared to traditional PWM controllers, MPPT will extract, on average, 30% more power from the same module! MPPT controllers essentially decouples the array and battery voltages. The MPPT system then operates the modules at 17.2 V to extract the full 120 W, regardless of present battery voltage.

                                            An electronic gizmo called a ‘high efficiency DC-to-DC power converter” converts the 17.2V module voltage at the controller input to battery voltage at the output. The greater the voltage difference between the Vmp and the battery, the more “boost” current the battery will receive. A consequence of this is: the less charged the batteries are (lower battery voltage), the more “boost” current they will receive. This is precisely the time when batteries will benefit from an increased amount of charging current.

                                            With a PWM controller we would achieve 6.98 Amps (as the Volts In is brought down to 12) while the MPPT gives us 10 Amps. Thus a decrease of 43% namely 3.02 Amps!

                                            The greater the voltage difference between the Vmp and the battery, the more “boost” current the battery will receive.

                                            From the picture above it is clear that the MPPT Output power is higher than that of the PWM as explained in the example.

                                            Using a standard PWM regulator, a decrease in temperature would correspond to reduced charging efficiency (because there is an increased difference between the Vmp and battery voltage). However, an MPPT controller tracks the increasing Vmp and converts the excess voltage being produced into additional charging current. In general, any rise in Vmp will increase an MPPT controller’s harvest relative to a PWM controller.

                                            The control of battery charging is so important that manufacturers of high quality batteries specify the requirements for voltage regulation, low voltage disconnect and temperature compensation.
