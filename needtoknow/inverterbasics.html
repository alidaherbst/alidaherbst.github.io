                                            <br /> A solar inverter is an electronic device that will convert Direct Current (DC) battery/solar panel voltage into Alternating Current (AC) mains type power, suitable for use in the home or business.

                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                            The inverter could be considered the spindle around which the rest of the equipment in a renewable / alternative / independent energy system revolves and is a complex instrument.
                                            <br />

                                            An inverter could best be described as a power adapter. It allows a battery-based or solar panel system to run conventional appliances through conventional home wiring.
                                            <br />
                                            There are ways to use lower voltage DC directly, but for a modern lifestyle, you will need an inverter for the vast majority, if not all of your loads (loads are devices that use electrical energy).
                                            <br />

                                            You don't have to understand an inverters exact inner functioning, but you should at least know some of its basic functions, capabilities, and limitations.
                                            <br />
                                            The inverter with a battery or battery bank can serve as part of a back-up system when grid electricity interruptions or failure occur, or can act as a fully-fledged grid independent (off-grid) system.
                                            <br />
                                            Inverters are available in many different sizes, voltages and types. The correct choice of inverter will depend on a number of factors relating to power requirement and application.

                                            Lets discuss some basic terminology often used when discussing inverters.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="H3"><strong>Watts. </strong></p>
                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                            Watts are basically just a measure of how much power a device uses when turned on.  It is a basic unit of electricity. The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy is dissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated.
                                            <br />
                                            There is no such thing as “watts per hour” or “watts per day”. If something uses 100 Watts, it is simply the voltage x the amps. Whether it pulls 10 Amps at 12 volts or 1 Amp at 120 Volts, it is still uses 120 Watt.
                                            <br />
                                            Technically, a Watt is defined as a bunch of Joules per second - saying watts per hour is like saying km per hour per day.
                                        </p>



                                        <p class="H3"><strong>Watt-hours. </strong></p>
                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                            A Watt-hour (or kilowatt-hour, kWh) is simply the Watt rating x the number of hours in use.  When people refer to their average energy consumption per day they often say for example 35 kWh.
                                            <br />
                                            Watt-hours are a measure of energy consumption. If a light uses 100 watts and it is on for 10 hours, then 100 x 10 = 1000 Wh were consumed.
                                            <br />
                                            If a kettle uses 2000 Watts and it is on for 6 minutes ( 6/60 = 0.1 hours), then 2000 x 0.1 = 200 Wh were consumed. When you buy “power” from Eskom, they sell it to you at so much per kWh.
                                            <br /> A kWh is a kilowatt hour, or 1000 watts for one hour. Or 1 Watt for 1000 hours.

                                        <p class="H3"><strong>Amps. </strong></p>
                                        <p class="paragraph">
                                            An Amp is a measure of electrical CURRENT at a given moment. (Amps do not come in “Amps per hour” either. Amps are important because it determines what wire size you need, especially on the low voltage DC side of the inverter.
                                            <br />
                                            A wire has resistance and amps flowing through it makes heat. If the wire is too small, you get hot wires! You also lose voltage if the wire is too small. Some of the voltage becomes heat. This is not a good thing!
                                            <br />
                                            Technically an Amp is defined as so many electrons per second.

                                            Amp-hours (or Ah for short) are what most people mean when they say “amps per hour”. Amps x hours = Ah. Ah is important, it is the main measure of battery capacity. Since most inverters run from batteries, their Ah capacity will determine how long you can run.

                                            A power inverter will often have an overall power rating expressed in watts or kilowatts. This describes the power that will be available to the device the inverter is driving and, indirectly, the power that will be needed from the DC source.
                                            <br />
                                            Smaller popular consumer and commercial devices designed to mimic line power typically range from 150 to 3000 watts.
                                            <br />
                                            Not all inverter applications are solely or primarily concerned with power delivery; in some cases the frequency and or waveform properties are used by the follow-on circuit or device.

                                            Peak is the maximum power that the inverter can supply, usually for only a short time. Surge rating will be specified for a certain wattage and a certain number of seconds. Will handle an overload for this period of time.

                                            <br />
                                            This equats to 3 600 Watts for 3 minutes,   4 500 Watts for 60 seconds,   6 kW for 30 seconds

                                            This inverter can be connected to and AC source (AC in) like Eskom or even a generator to serve as a back up source of energy.

                                            Off grid inverters are used with battery banks and are designed to work with specific nominal DC voltages - 12, 24, 36 or 48 volts.

                                            A particular inverter can only be used with its designed nominal voltage. You can’t use a 24 V inverter with a 48 V battery bank.

                                            An Off-grid solar PV system is expensive so it is important to find means to reduce your energy requirement and have a wide range of energy resources.
                                            <br />
                                            But when you install a system with batteries, you have to stay on top of things. The battery or battery pack is the core of any off-grid system, and it drives the system's cost.
