                                                Substantial information is available in books and on the internet about batteries and that can be confusing. Here are some basic info and tips on batteries that is important to know.

                                In plain and simple terms, a battery is an energy storage device that turns chemicals / metals into stored electricity. The battery is then used / tapped for its stored electricity. The effective operational life of a battery will depend on how much energy / electricity you tap from the battery and how much you put back in it again.
                                Batteries are finite and have a limited cycle life dependent on the energy withdrawal and insertion cycle.  <br />

                                The lead acid battery in its commercial application is more than a 100 years old and was designed for use in lighting, radios and the first electric cars. The same chemical principal that is being used to store energy is basically the same as the original designs from a 100 years ago. Batteries are currently the subject of intensive international research and despite major advances in the electronics industry with inverters, solar panels and charge controllers the exact functioning of batteries remains a mystery to even the most astute scientists. New battery technologies are being developed but the mainstay currently is still the lead acid battery. To be quite honest, batteries are the weak link in any renewable energy system and you therefore have to choose and design a system wisely. Per item, the consumable batteries are the most expensive items in your whole system – buy a cheap battery and get cheap performance.
                                That is also why battery warranties are configured in the favor of battery manufactures – very few offer more than a year warranty.<br />

                                What you require of a battery or battery bank is performance, reliability, and longevity – as far as possible. A battery is like a water tank – what you take out, you have to put back in. The average battery life has become shorter due to the increase in energy / electricity requirements. The life span of a battery is dependent on its pattern of engagement / use.

                                Safety is important when you are working with batteries or in its environment. The hydrogen gas that batteries produce when charging is very explosive. It is therefore important to note that you are dealing with corrosive acid, explosive gases and hundreds of Amperes in electrical current.
                                Sufficient ventilation and moderate temperature are essential elements in battery placement.<br />

                                Lead acid batteries are compiled of plates, lead, and lead oxide (a number of other elements are used to change density, hardness, porosity, etc.) with a 35% sulfuric acid and 65% water solution and encased in a non-corrosive container. The battery solution is called an electrolyte, which results in a chemical reaction that produce electrons. When you test a non-sealed battery with a hydrometer, you are measuring the amount of sulfuric acid in the electrolyte. If your reading is low, that means the chemistry that produces electrons is lacking. The Sulphur now resides on the battery plates and when you recharge the battery, the sulfur returns to the electrolyte.                            </p>

                                    Gel Cell and some AGM batteries may require a special charging rate which you will find settings for on a well-designed inverter / charger and / or solar and wind charge controller. If you want the best, most versatile type, consideration should be given to the AGM battery for solar applications. If you don't use or operate your equipment daily, AGM batteries will hold their charge better that other types. In most cases AGM batteries will give greater life span and greater cycle life than a wet cell battery.

                                When buying a new battery we suggest you purchase a battery with the greatest reserve capacity or amp hour rating possible. Of course the physical size, cable hook up, and terminal type must be a consideration. You may want to consider a Gel Cell or an Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) rather than a Wet Cell if the application is in a harsher environment or the battery is not going to receive regular maintenance and charging. 
                            Ensure that you purchase the correct type of battery for the specific work it must do.

                                Using computer technology can perform 3 step charging techniques and typically found on the better quality chargers or inverter chargers.
                                 The first step is bulk charging where up to 80% of the battery energy capacity is replaced by the charger at the maximum voltage and current ampere rating of the charger.
                                 When the battery voltage reaches a certain level this commences the absorption charge step.
                                 This is where the voltage is held at a constant voltage and the current (amperes) declines until the battery is 98% charged. Next comes the Float Step. 
                                This is a regulated voltage of not more than a certain voltage and usually much less current. This in time will bring the battery to 100% charged or close to it.
                                 The float charge will not boil or heat batteries but will maintain the batteries at 100% readiness and prevent cycling during long term inactivity.
